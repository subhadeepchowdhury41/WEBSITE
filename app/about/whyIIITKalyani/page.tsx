                        Dedicated to the service of the Nation Motto The motto of IIIT Kalyani is &quot;vidya dharma sarva dhanam pradhanam&quot;. This literally translates to &quot;Education is the most important wealth&quot;, essentially implying that doing your work well is (true) yoga. This can be traced to Sri Krishna&apos;s discourse with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. The quote, in the larger context of the Gita, urges man to acquire equanimity because a mind of equanimity allows a man to shed distracting thoughts of the effects of his deeds and concentrate on the task before him. Equanimity is the source of perfection in Karmic endeavours that leads to Salvation.
