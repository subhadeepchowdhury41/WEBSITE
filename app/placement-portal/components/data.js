However, the placement records of previous years are quite encouraging with continuous improvement over the years. The young and vibrant faculty members of the Institute have made sure that adequate knowledge is imparted to the students, making them ready to pick up the technological and management challenges in their career. With the kind of grooming we give our students in both theory and practical aspects of their engineering curriculum, I am sure that frontier companies in the domain of Information Technology will be highly interested in recruiting them. In the broader picture, I see this as an overall development in terms of socio-technical growth in our country.",
